# VOC Search & Discovery

Answer questions about VOC data using these tools:

- **"What are customers asking for?"** → `list_themes` sorted by priority_score
- **"What has [company] requested?"** → `get_voc_analytics` with analysis_type=company_feedback
- **"Find items about [topic]"** → `search_voc_items` or `find_similar_voc_items`
- **"What themes are trending?"** → `get_voc_analytics` with analysis_type=trending_themes
- **"Tell me about [theme]"** → `get_theme_details`
- **"What calls mentioned [topic]?"** → `search_transcripts_semantic`
- **"Show me the VOC dashboard"** → Read the `voc://dashboard` resource

Use `summarize_theme` prompt for executive briefings on specific themes.
